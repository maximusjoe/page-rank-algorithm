# PageRank Algorithm Implementation in C++ using Matrices

This is a GitHub project that contains an implementation of the PageRank algorithm in C++ using matrices. The PageRank algorithm is a method used by Google to rank websites in their search engine results. It works by assigning a score to each website based on the number of incoming links it receives from other high-quality websites.

In this implementation, we use a matrix-based approach to calculate the PageRank scores. We represent the websites as nodes in a directed graph and use a matrix to represent the relationships between the nodes. We then use iterative matrix multiplication to calculate the PageRank scores for each website.

This project includes the C++ source code for the implementation, as well as sample input files and instructions for how to run the program. It is a great resource for anyone interested in learning more about the PageRank algorithm or matrix-based approaches to solving complex problems.
